# Network Traffic Classification
## Overview

This project aims to classify network traffic using three different machine learning techniques: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification is implemented using the Scikit-learn library.

## Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-traffic-classification.git
cd network-traffic-classification

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

    Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
    Run the classification script:

    bash

    python classify.py

    The results will be displayed in the console and saved in the results/ directory.

## Techniques

### XGBoost

XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible, and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework.
Random Forest

### Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method for classification that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.
Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Support Vector

Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. SVMs are effective in high-dimensional spaces and are still effective when the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.
